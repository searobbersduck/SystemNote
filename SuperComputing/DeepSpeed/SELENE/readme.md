> The air-cooled Selene was constructed in a standard data center in only three weeks, compared to the 9-12-month time frame typically required to create a typical supercomputer installation.

> This fast deployment was made possible by NVIDIA’s plug and play DGX system that houses AMD CPUs, A100 GPUs, and Mellanox HDDR networking. 

> Now a customer can go directly to an NVIDIA Partner Network reseller or a DGX-Ready Data Center Partner to install or gain cloud access to a DGX, DGX POD, or DGX SuperPOD. To be sure, a DGX A100 is not cheap, starting at $199K, but a customer can be up and running in a matter of weeks, not months, and can expect a smooth installation with low risks.

> Selene itself is comprised of 280 DGX A100s, amounting to a list price of $56M if someone wants to buy one.

> AI and HPC continue to expand the frontiers of exploration, but today’s most challenging opportunities require a new architecture that can deliver unprecedented levels of computing scale to drive faster insights from massive volumes of data. Where traditional high-performance compute clusters take months or years to deploy, NVIDIA’s Selene supercomputer, built on the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD™ reference architecture, offers a faster path to massive scale, in a Top10-class supercomputer that was deployed in under a month.
